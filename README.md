swift-smc
=========

A System Management Controller (SMC) API in Swift from user space for Intel
based Macs. The API works by talking to the AppleSMC.kext (kernel
extension), the closed source driver for the SMC.


### System Management Controller

_"The System Management Controller (SMC) is an internal subsystem introduced by
Apple Inc. with the introduction of their new Intel processor based machines
in 2006. It takes over the functions of the SMU. The SMC manages thermal and
power conditions to optimize the power and airflow while keeping audible noise
to a minimum. Power consumption and temperature are monitored by the operating
system, which communicates the necessary adjustments back to the SMC. The SMC
makes the changes, slowing down or speeding up fans as necessary."_

### Requirements

- Xcode 6 - Beta 6
- OS X 10.9+


### Installation

_"The infrastructure and best practices for distributing Swift libraries is
currently being developed by the developer community during this beta period of
the language and Xcode. In the meantime, you can simply copy the smc.swift file
into your Xcode project."_

### Usage

```swift
import IOKit

var smc = SMC()

// Open a connection to the SMC
if (smc.openSMC() == kIOReturnSuccess) {
    var result = smc.getTMP(SMC.TMP.CPU_0_DIODE)

    println("CPU 0 Diode Temperature: \(result.tmp)Â°C")
    println("IO Return Code: \(result.IOReturn)")
    println("SMC Return Code: \(result.kSMC)")

    // Make sure to close the connection
    smc.closeSMC()
}
else {
    println("ERROR: Failed to open connection to SMC")
}
```


### References

There are many projects that interface with the SMC for one purpose or another. Credit is most
certainly due to them for the reference code. Such projects as:

### Fun

In the very same
[PrivateLib.c](https://www.opensource.apple.com/source/PowerManagement/PowerManagement-211/pmconfigd/PrivateLib.c)
file, the following snippet can be found:

```c
// And simply AppleSMC with kCFBooleanTrue to let them know time is changed.
// We don't pass any information down.
IORegistryEntrySetCFProperty( _smc,
                    CFSTR("TheTimesAreAChangin"),
                    kCFBooleanTrue);
```
