_"The System Management Controller (SMC) is an internal subsystem introduced by
Apple Inc. with the introduction of their new Intel processor based machines
in 2006. It takes over the functions of the SMU. The SMC manages thermal and
power conditions to optimize the power and airflow while keeping audible noise
to a minimum. Power consumption and temperature are monitored by the operating
system, which communicates the necessary adjustments back to the SMC. The SMC
makes the changes, slowing down or speeding up fans as necessary."_
